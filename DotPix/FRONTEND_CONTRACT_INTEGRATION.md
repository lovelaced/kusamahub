# Frontend-Contract Integration Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Function Error**
- **Problem**: The deployed contract (`PixelCanvasV2`) doesn't have `getPixelsByRange` function
- **Solution**: Updated the ABI and modified the hook to use the `pixels` mapping directly

### 2. **Event Loading Optimization**
- **Problem**: Trying to load all 4M pixels was inefficient
- **Solution**: Load only placed pixels by querying blockchain events

### 3. **TypeScript Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Type errors with event args
- **Solution**: Added proper type guards for event processing

## Key Changes Made

### Updated Contract ABI
```typescript
// Removed: getPixelsByRange
// Added: pixels(uint256) mapping access
```

### Event-Based Loading
- Queries `PixelPlaced` and `BatchPixelsPlaced` events
- Loads only pixels that have been placed
- Much more efficient than scanning all 4M pixels

### Fixed Integration Points
- ✅ Pixel placement works with real blockchain transactions
- ✅ Event listening for real-time updates
- ✅ Proper fee calculation and distribution
- ✅ Conflict detection with on-chain data

## Testing the Integration

1. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect MetaMask**:
   - Ensure you're on PASEO network (Chain ID: 420420422)
   - Have some PAS tokens for placing pixels

3. **Verify existing pixels**:
   - Should see the test pixels placed during contract testing:
     - Red pixel at position 12345
     - Green, Blue, Yellow pixels at positions 54321-54323

4. **Place new pixels**:
   - Select pixels on the canvas
   - Choose a color
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - Watch for real-time updates

## Contract Details
- **Address**: `0xfC72434Ce268668d0F946bFAcB59F6D8d728eC0E`
- **Network**: PASEO TestNet
- **Base Fee**: 0.001 PAS per pixel
- **Fee Distribution**: 49% burned, 51% to recipient

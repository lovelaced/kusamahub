# KusamaHub TimeCube 🌀

> **stop behaving. start blockraving.**

A chaotic collection of Kusama-native dapps that embrace the network's experimental spirit. Built with anarchic competence and zero corporate polish.

## What is this madness?

KusamaHub is where serious DeFi meets unserious UX. We're building the tools Kusama deserves - functional, weird, and unapologetically experimental. Think of it as the digital equivalent of a late-night hackathon that never ended.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that embrace the chaos while maintaining functionality. 

### Guidelines:
- **Anarchic competence**: Build things that work, but with personality
- **No corporate speak**: Keep copy weird and human
- **Embrace the glitch**: Perfect is the enemy of interesting
- **Test on Kusama**: If it works on mainnet, it's probably too safe

### Development Principles:
1. **Functionality first**: It must work before it can be weird
2. **User experience**: Chaos should be intentional, not accidental
3. **Performance**: Fast and weird beats slow and pretty
4. **Accessibility**: Everyone deserves access to the chaos

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy to Vercel
pnpm build
vercel --prod
\`\`\`

### Self-hosted
\`\`\`bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
\`\`\`

# Wallets
kusamahub.com is built on top of Kusama Asset Hub's EVM-compatible environment, and as such, users must use an EVM-compatible wallet when interacting with the site.

You can connect to the site with a wallet that supports both Subtrate and EVM, such as Nova Wallet, Talisman, or Subwallet. 

If you are using a wallet which only supports Substrate networks & transactions, such as Polkadot JS extension, then you need to carry out one of the following operations in order to send transactions:
A) Import your account via its seedphrase into an EVM-compatible wallet.
B) Transfer KSM tokens from your Substrate-only wallet to an EVM-compatible wallet. You can do this by using kusamahub.com's transfer page. 

Your KSM tokens must be on Kusama Asset Hub, in an EVM-compatible wallet, in order to use kusamahub.com. If you have tokens on an incorrect network, such as the Kusama Relay Chain, or have tokens in an incompatible wallet, such as the Polkadot JS extension, you will not be able to use this site.
